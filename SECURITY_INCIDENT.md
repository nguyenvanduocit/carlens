# üö® SECURITY INCIDENT REPORT - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

## Summary
**Critical security vulnerability detected**: MongoDB credentials were committed to the Git repository.

## Details
- **Date Committed**: August 10, 2025
- **Commit Hash**: `650d8c94adb298bf31bdcccacf244b344f227ee9`
- **Affected Files**: 
  - `packages/server/index.js`
  - `packages/sync/sync-to-mongodb.ts`
- **Exposed Credentials**: 
  - MongoDB URI: `mongodb+srv://[REDACTED]@cluster0.fpdwl75.mongodb.net/`
  - Username: `[REDACTED]`
  - Password: `[REDACTED]` ‚ö†Ô∏è **COMPROMISED**

## Status
- ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**: Hardcoded credentials removed from current codebase
- ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**: Git history rewritten to remove compromised credentials
- ‚ùå **PENDING**: MongoDB password rotation still required (credentials were public)

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Change MongoDB Password (URGENT - Do this first!)
```bash
# Connect to MongoDB Atlas and change the password for user 'nguyenvanduocit'
# Or create new user with different credentials
```

### 2. Update Environment Variables
```bash
# Update your .env file with new credentials
cp packages/server/.env.example packages/server/.env
# Edit packages/server/.env with new credentials
```

### 3. Git History Cleanup ‚úÖ COMPLETED
The credentials have been successfully removed from git history using `git filter-branch`.

**Actions taken:**
- Created backup tag: `backup-before-cleanup-20250811-004759`
- Used `git filter-branch` to rewrite history and remove credentials
- Cleaned up git references and performed garbage collection
- Verified no compromised credentials remain in git history

## Prevention Measures Implemented

### ‚úÖ Code Changes
- Removed hardcoded credentials from all source files
- Implemented proper environment variable usage with fallbacks
- Added dotenv configuration for environment loading

### ‚úÖ Repository Security
- Enhanced `.gitignore` to prevent future .env commits
- Added comprehensive environment file patterns
- Created security documentation and guidelines

### ‚úÖ Documentation
- Updated README with proper environment setup
- Created SECURITY.md with reporting procedures
- Added CONTRIBUTING.md with security best practices

## Verification Steps

### 1. Confirm Current Code is Clean
```bash
# Should return no results
git grep -r "[REDACTED]" -- ":(exclude)SECURITY_INCIDENT.md"
git grep -r "mongodb+srv://nguyenvanduocit" -- ":(exclude)SECURITY_INCIDENT.md"
```

### 2. Test Environment Variable Loading
```bash
# Should use environment variables, not hardcoded values
cd packages/server && node -e "
require('dotenv').config();
console.log('MONGODB_URI:', process.env.MONGODB_URI ? 'Found' : 'Not found');
"
```

### 3. Verify .env Files Are Ignored
```bash
# Should show .env files are ignored
git status  # .env files should not appear as untracked
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Never commit secrets**: Always use environment variables
2. **Review before commit**: Check diffs for sensitive information
3. **Use git hooks**: Implement pre-commit hooks to scan for secrets
4. **Environment templates**: Use .env.example files
5. **Security scanning**: Regular automated security scans

## Next Steps

1. ‚ö†Ô∏è  **URGENT**: Change MongoDB password immediately
2. üîÑ Update all environments with new credentials
3. üìä Audit database access logs for suspicious activity
4. üõ°Ô∏è  Consider implementing additional security measures:
   - IP whitelisting for database access
   - Database connection encryption
   - Regular credential rotation
   - Automated secret scanning in CI/CD
