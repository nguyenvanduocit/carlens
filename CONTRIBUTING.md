## üõ†Ô∏è Development Guidelines

### Project Structure

This is a monorepo with the following packages:
- `packages/server/` - Fastify backend API
- `packages/webapp/` - Vue 3 frontend application  
- `packages/shared-types/` - Shared TypeScript types
- `packages/sync/` - MongoDB synchronization utility

### Code Standards

#### TypeScript
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Maintain strict type safety
- Use shared types from `@carlens/shared-types` where applicable
- Follow existing naming conventions

#### Frontend (Vue 3)
- Use Composition API exclusively
- Follow Vue 3 best practices and conventions
- Use existing composables and utilities
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Use Vue ECharts for data visualization

#### Backend (Fastify)
- Follow RESTful API conventions
- Use proper HTTP status codes
- Implement error handling
- Use MongoDB time-series collections for telemetry data
- Maintain API documentation

#### Code Style
- Use existing ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Run linting before submitting: `bun run lint`
- Run type checking: `bun run type-check`
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions

### Commit Guidelines

We use conventional commits for clear and consistent commit messages:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
